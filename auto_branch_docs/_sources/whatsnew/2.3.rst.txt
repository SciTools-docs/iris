Iris 2.3 Features
=================
* :class:`iris.experimental.regrid.PointInCell` moved to
:class:`iris.analysis.PointInCell` to make this regridding scheme public

----

* Iris now makes better choices of dask chunk sizes, when loading from netcdf
  files:  If a file variable has specified, small chunks, Iris will now choose
  dask chunks which are a multiple of these, up to a default target size.
  This is particularly relevant to files with an unlimited dimension, which
  previously could produce a large number of small chunks.
  In addition, Iris now takes its default chunksize from the default configured
  in dask itself, i.e. `dask.config.get('array.chunk-size')`.

----


Bugs Fixed
==========
* The name of cubes loaded from abf/abl files has been corrected.

----

* :meth:`iris.cube.Cube.collapsed` now handles partial collapsing of
multidimensional coordinates that have bounds.

----

* :meth:`iris.cube.Cube.aggregated_by` now gives correct values in points and
bounds when handling multidimensional coordinates.
